** THIS REPO HAS TWO BRANCHES! THE DEFAULT BRANCH WAS MADE FOR THE GH-PAGES DEPLOYMENT. TO SEE MY CODE, SWITCH TO THE 'master' BRANCH! **

This is the first time I've ever heard of React, the first time I've even touched an API, and the first time since sophomore year of high school I've worked with JavaScript. Keeping this in mind, I decided to scale down my project since I knew I wouldn't complete it entirely, especially with the loads of other work on my agenda. My general plan went as follows:

1. Create a simple UI for my page to start (Header and Footer)

2. Create buttons for users to click on to access the parks  I've selected. I started with only four, but planned on adding more in a later step.

3. Figure out how to use the API to get the parks associated with a specific activity. I made a file called Parks.js to accomplish this, but this would ultimately prove to be my downfall for this project. (This step is also why "Results" is displayed under the footer)

4. Make it so that when one of the buttons (activities) was clicked the parks associated with the corresponding activity would be displayed. I couldn't decide whether I wanted the results on a different page or changing the same page to reflect the results, but I was leaning towards the former.

5. Add more activities so that visitors had more options and use the knwoledge gained from steps 3-4 to implement functionality in them.

6. If I had time, add another button for visitors to access the park cams. I would elaborate on this process through additional steps, but I have no idea where to even start, let alone how I was going to accomplish this. If I ever made it to this step but didn't have time, I would've skipped to step 7.

7. Polish the UI to make the website more intuitive and pleasing on the eyes.

8. Polish the code to make it easier to read.

9. Deploy the web app, set up my github repo, and submit my work.

Unfortunately, this plan didn't pan out because I was perpetually stuck on step 3. I knew how to get the results, but not how to get them to display outside of the console. I also tried using axios, another tool I used for the first time, to no avail.

Despite all of this, I still found the challenge fun. I always find satisfaction in coding, even when I get stumped.
